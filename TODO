- Dirty beam convolution instead of explicit FCF

- NUFFT still fails for non-square grids and/or odd grid dimensions... is it the pcenter hack???

- Mask in convolution matrix

- Joint modeling of multiple data sets!!!

- Use Python FFTs

- dtype as part of Space superclass

- Mask as part of VisibilitySpace

- All TODOs in code

- Documentation!!!

- Clean up unit tests, split into more manageable files

- Split out operator_base into specific files

- Concatenating explicit matrices

- Re-organize sub-modules ('spaces', 'util'?)

- Make cosmology a global property?

- Broadcasting to full data shape, including channels and stokes

- Get rid of space names...

- Use 2F1 series for all deflection computations

- Maximum edge length in lens plane tessellation

- Regularization operators

- How is the visibility mask done?

- Solver framework

- Make the covariance weight application slicker?
